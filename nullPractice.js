// What is Null - https://www.altcademy.com/blog/what-is-null-in-javascript/

// Null
const nullVar = null;
console.log(nullVar); //null
console.log(typeof(nullVar)); //object

// Undefined
const undefinedVar = undefined;
console.log(undefinedVar); //undefined
console.log(typeof(undefinedVar)); //undefined

// One common pitfall for new developers is to confuse null with undefined. While both seem to indicate emptiness or absence of value, they are not the same.
// Consider undefined as an empty plot of land where nothing has been built yet. On the other hand, null is like a plot where a building was planned but never built. The foundation was laid, but there's no building there.
